# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

Rules of the game:
1. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
2. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation (survival).
4. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
5. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

Once you run the program, You will be prompted to enter a grid height and width.
Alive cells will be yellow in color. Dead cells will be grey in color.

Controls:
* Clicking down on a dead cell will make it alive and vice-versa 
* The R key is used to reset the grid (i.e, make all the cells dead)
* The UP ARROW key is used to generate a random grid with alive and dead cells
* The RIGHT ARROW key is used to move ahead in the simulation by 1 step 
* The SPACE key is used to run the simulation at a fixed speed
* The D key is used to make the simulation speed up
* The S key is used to make the simulation slow down (It will not go below its initial predefined speed)
